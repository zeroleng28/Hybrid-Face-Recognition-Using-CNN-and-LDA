# Hybrid Face Recognition Using CNN and LDA

A hybrid face recognition system to identify individuals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with classical machine learning models.

## üîç Overview
This project compares three face recognition models:
- CNN (ResNet50)
- LDA + Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- LDA + Random Forest

Tested on a custom dataset of Blackpink members and evaluated on real-world web images.

## üß† Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib, NumPy

## üìä Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Feature extraction with CNN and LDA
- Classification with SVM and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Real-world image testing for generalization
